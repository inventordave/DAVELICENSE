With great code, comes great responsibility.
Maybe some accolade of a sort, perhaps. Money is always a useful commodity.
Money, famously, is not a Non-Fungible asset, but it sure can buy a lot of Non-Fungible assets.

I dreamed a dream. In that dream, was a dream within a dream. An in-dream dream, if you will. Well, dream no more, for the end of the rainbow is here.
DAVELICENSEses are finally here, so you can finally stop dreaming, and deliver great inventions, licensed the way you want them to be. With a DAVELICENSE.
Really, it's true, honest. You can now literally issue intellectual property licenses with a license with my name on it. I know! Right?! It's indistinguishable from magic, really.

Disclaimer: You can't sue me. I will deny any punitive claim you bring against the House of Dave. Carte Blanche, so be warned. I am a brilliant legal mind, and also I've watched a lot of The Practise, LA Law, that kind of stuff. You can't hold me in contempt, I hold myself in contempt. You're out of order, everybody's out of order, the whole system's out of order. Not me though, and if you assert otherwise, I'll sue you for every penny you've got. If I lose, then hah, joke's on you, all my money's tied up in the ex-missus fund. A lot like my exes, it disappears quickly, and takes quite a long time to turn up again. Life imitating Art imitating Life. And, if you believe what people say about me, imitating Art. If you don't, thank you for your grace, I maintain that people tell very mean-spirited lies about me. It was not me, it was the 9-fingered man, and I maintain my innocence to the very end. In conclusion and summary, to wit, I couldn't possibly have done anything wrong.
